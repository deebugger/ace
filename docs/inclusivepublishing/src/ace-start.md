# Ace, by DAISY

Ace, the Accessibility Checker for EPUB, is a tool developed by the [DAISY Consortium](http://daisy.org) to assist with the evaluation of the accessibility of EPUB publications. Its automated accessibility checks assist in the evaluation of conformance to the [EPUB Accessibility](http://www.idpf.org/epub/latest/accessibility) specification.

It is important to keep in mind that a limited portion of accessibility checks can be automated. Therefore, __Ace is not a complete accessibility conformance evaluation tool; instead, it is an aid for a broader, human driven evaluation process__.

This document is intended to help new users get started with Ace. Additional documentation, recommended for advanced users, can be found over at [github](https://daisy.github.io/ace).

# Important note about Beta testing
This tool is remains in development and is not currently ready for everyone to use. We are actively seeking technical experts from the publishing industry to assist by offering feedback on this beta release, to refine the Ace tool ready for a mainstream release later this year. If you are not a technical publishing expert, please join our mailing list for news about subsequent releases and other industry news.

# Basics

 Ace is a command line tool, which means that you'll run it by typing commands into a terminal window (also called a _"shell"_ or _"command prompt"_). Here's how to open a terminal window:

* On Windows: `Windows System->Command Prompt` _or_ `Start->Run->cmd.exe`
* On Mac: `Applications->Utilities->Terminal`

Depending on which style of terminal window you use, the actual prompt might look like a dollar sign (`$`) or a greater-than sign (`>`), perhaps preceded by something (e.g. `c:\>`). The convention used here is `$` followed by what you should type (i.e. you don't type the dollar sign, that's just to indicate that we're using the command prompt).

Another thing you should understand before using Ace is how to type the path to a file. E.g. if I have a file named `my-book.epub` in my `Documents` directory, its path would be:

* On Mac: `~/Documents/my-book.epub` (or, in expanded form, `/Users/username/Documents/my-book.epub`)
* On Windows: `c:\Users\username\Documents\my-book.epub`.

You may use relative or absolute paths. 

Ace will require that you enter the path to your EPUB file and also the path where you would like Ace's report stored.

## Installation

_Note: internet connectivity is required for both installation steps_

### Install Node.JS

Ace relies on an open source Javascript framework called Node, which is freely available to download. You must install Node first before installing Ace. Node installation requires administrator privileges.

* Go to [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/)
* Download version 6 or higher
* Double-click to install and follow the instructions.


### Install Ace

* After installing Node, open a terminal window
* Type `$ npm install ace-core -g` to install Ace

If everything went smoothly, you should now be able to run the `ace` command in your terminal window. Try typing

```
$ ace --help
```

Ace should display usage information and then exit.

## Usage

### Checking an EPUB

You can check an EPUB by running the `ace` command followed by the path to the EPUB document. For example:

```
$ ace ~/Documents/moby-dick.epub
```

The above command will run the automated accessibility tests on the EPUB document and output the results in the terminal window.

### Storing the results

You can specify the directory for Ace to store its output with the `--outdir` option. For example:

```
$ ace --outdir ~/Documents/moby-dick-report ~/Documents/moby-dick.epub
```

_Note that if you do not specify a directory with `--outdir`, no reports get saved. You would only see output in the terminal window._

If the specified directory does not exist, it will be created. In this example, two versions of the results report will be found under the `~/Documents/moby-dick-report` directory:

* `report.html`: A human-readable version of the report, in HTML format.
* `report.json`: A machine-readable version of the report, in JSON format

## The report

Open `report.html` in your web browser to see the results. The report contains several sections, described below.

### Violations table

The report contains a table listing the violations found in the EPUB. The table columns are:

* `Impact`: the severity of the violation
* `Rule`: identifier for the rule that was violated
* `Location`: where in the book the violation occurred
* `Details`: suggestions on how to fix the problem, as well as a link to the relevant topic page in our online knowledge base.

There is a set of drop-down filters at the top of the table where you can refine by Impact, File, and Rule.

### Outlines

The outlines are intended to assist with manual checking. They represent extracted views of different aspects of the EPUB. The outlines are:

* __Table of contents__, taken from the EPUB navigation document
* __Headings__, including indications of missing heading levels (i.e. going from `h1` to `h3` with no `h2` in between)
* __HTML__, which represents heading content and sectioning content

### Accessibility metadata summary

This section lists both present accessibility metadata, summarized in a table, as well as a list of what's missing or empty.

### Images

This table contains each image in the EPUB and information about it. The table columns are:

* `Image`: the image itself
* `alt attribute`: the contents of the `alt` attribute
* `aria-describedby`: the contents of the element referenced by the `aria-describedby` attribute
* `Associated figcaption`: the `figcaption` for this image
* `Location`: location in the EPUB of this image

# Feedback

What to do if something goes wrong:

In the first instance check the Ace issue tracker on Github to see if you have encountered a known issue which weâ€™re working on. If the issue is not currently documented please raise it as a new issue on Github.

We also welcome your broader comments about the tool at any time during the beta testing process. Please use the Ace feedback form.
