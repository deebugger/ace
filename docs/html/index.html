<h1 id="ace-by-daisy">Ace, by DAISY</h1>
<p>Ace, the Accessibility Checker for EPUB, is a tool developed by the <a href="http://daisy.org">DAISY Consortium</a> to assist with the evaluation of accessibility features of EPUB publications.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ace-">What is Ace?</h2>
<p>Ace is a tool to run automated accessibility checks for EPUB Publications, in order to assist in the evaluation of conformance to the <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/latest/accessibility">EPUB Accessibility</a> specification.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that only a limited portion of accessibility checks can be automated, and therefore <strong>Ace is just a helper tool to assist in a broader, human-driven, evaluation process</strong>.</p>
<p>Under the hood, Ace currently runs the <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core">aXe engine for automated testing of HTML</a>, developed by the good folks at Deque Systems.</p>
